# AM2302

I have great respect for the work of AdaFruit, but I do not want to be dependent on their ecosystem (libraries).  So I always write my own code to communicate with devices.

Here is a very simple Python code for the Raspberry Pi that communicates with the AM2302 sensor that measures temperature and relative humidity. It only uses the **pigpio** library.

If there is interest, I can also write a simple C code for Arduino.
