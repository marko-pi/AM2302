# AM2302

I have great respect for AdaFruit work, but I do not want to depend on their ecosystem.  I therefore always write my own code to communicate with devices.  Here is a very simple code to communicate with AM2302 sensor that measures temperature and relative humidity.  It uses **pigpio** library only.
